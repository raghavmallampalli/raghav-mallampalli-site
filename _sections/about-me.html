<p>I am Raghav Mallampalli. I enjoy the sciences, technology and geopolitics and tolerate mathematics.</p>
<p>I've been educated according to the CBSE curriculum in the Science with Computer Science stream and am pursuing a Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Bachelor's plus Master's (Dual) degree in IIT Madras, Chennai.</p>
<p>I have experience in design engineering, 3D Printing, FEM, Web Development and Python programming. See my résumé <a href="#">here</a>. I am open to designing websites for individuals. I can be contacted via my <a class="mail-id" href="mailto:raghavmallampalli1234@gmail.com">personal mail</a>.</p>
<p>I write articles, critiques and short stories which I publish on Medium and here. Almost everything you see on this site (art, blogs and code) was made or written by me. The original author or artist has been credited when that's not the case.</p>
